# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We, as members of the internal development team for SocialDetox.ai, are committed to maintaining a respectful and inclusive environment for all collaborators.

While external contributions are currently not permitted, we expect all interactions — whether within the team or from the public (e.g., bug reports, feature requests) — to be professional and respectful.

## Our Standards

To maintain a positive work environment, we ask all participants to follow these guidelines:

-   Be respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.
-   Offer constructive feedback and accept constructive criticism.
-   Avoid derogatory or offensive comments.
-   Keep all interactions professional and in good faith.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, including but not limited to discussions in issues, the repository, and communication channels directly related to the project.

## Reporting Issues

If you witness or experience behavior that does not meet our standards, please report it to <hello@socialdetox.ai> so we can address the situation appropriately.

Thank you for your understanding.
