# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

**Please do not open GitHub issues or pull requests** - this makes the problem immediately visible to everyone, including malicious actors.

Security issues in this open-source project can be safely reported to <security@socialdetox.ai>, a no-reply e-mail address.

Our security team will triage your report and act according to its impact on users and systems.

Thank you for your understanding.
